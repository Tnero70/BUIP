==Background==

Malleability is not an issue when working only with confirmed tx.
But if an application wants to reference an unconfirmed tx based on its tx id it could fail if said id is changed (malleate).

==Motivation==
Allow applications to use unconfirmed tx based on a non-malleable id.
This could open up Bitcoin Cash to new technology we do not know of today.

==Task==
The Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer shall engage in the discussion with other consensus implementations and propose a solution.
The solution can be already proposed by others or a new one.

The solution must be opt-in and mustn't require existing inputs to be moved first (e.g. with SegWit where the tx has to originate from a SegWit address).

==Timetable==
The malleability fix shall be developed and to be implemented to BUCash no later than in the scheduled HF of November 2018.
